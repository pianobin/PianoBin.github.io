If you are here then chances are we have similar interests so I would love to hear what you want me to cover. However please note the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Does the song already have many piano covers? If the song is too popular then I am less likely to arrange it because there are many other songs that deserve a piano arrangement :)</li>\n<li>I try to cover songs from media I am familiar with. If you suggest a song from video game or movie I haven’t heard of then I will need some time to check it out first before deciding!</li>\n<li>Lastly, I am only one person so I am not able to do everyone’s request!</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Can I use your arrangement for my video?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes!<br>\nYou may create covers or remixes using my piano tutorials, sheet music, or MIDI files as reference. You may also use the audio from my videos as background music for your own videos. Please credit me if possible!</p>\n<p>If you create something based on my piano arrangements, please don’t hesitate to show me! I would love to see your creative work.</p>\n<p>Note: If you plan to create commercial works please make sure to acquire the rights from the original copyright holder</p>\n<p><strong>Where can I find the sheet music for X arrangement?</strong></p>\n<p>I have organized some of my recent projects in the sidebar of this website, but a lot of my older projects exist in various other pages outside of this website.\nBelow is an Airtable with sheet music links to all previous arrangements I have made. It also includes additional links to audio and MIDI files available on Patreon.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 20px 0; width: 150%;\">\n<iframe class=\"airtable-embed\" src=\"https://airtable.com/embed/appfWHDc7lMbK5Nqx/shr75QTz5ASYVk2Fk?viewControls=on\" frameborder=\"0\" onmousewheel=\"\" width=\"100%\" height=\"533\" style=\"background: transparent; border: 1px solid #ccc;\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<p><strong>How to donate?</strong></p>\n<p>If you found my work helpful feel free to support me on <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/pianobin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Patreon</a>!</p>\n<p><strong>Have more questions or comments?</strong></p>\n<p>The best way to reach me is through email: <em><strong>shoji AT pianobin.com</strong></em>.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"","date":null,"description":null,"socialImage":"./photo.png"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"///"}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","401334301","63107425","996999852"]}
