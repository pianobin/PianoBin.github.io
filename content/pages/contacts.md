You are free to create covers, remixes, etc. based on my piano tutorials, sheet music, or MIDI/audio files. You may also use the audio from my videos as background music for your own videos. Please credit my [channel](https://www.youtube.com/pianobin) when possible.

Suggested Example:

```
Arrangement by Pianobin

```

If you do create something based on my piano arrangements, please don't hesitate to show me! I love seeing your creative work.
