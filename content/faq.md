## Welcome to pianobin's sheet music collection!

Hi there, thank you for visiting my corner of the internet!  

My name is **Pianobin**, and I have been writing piano arrangements for more than 7 years.  
I cover all kinds of music, but I focus on video game and animated film OSTs!

## FAQ

**Do you take requests?**

I read all requests and many of my past arrangements have come from requests! If you are here then chances are we have similar interests so I would love to hear what you want me to cover. However please note the following:

- Does the song already have many piano covers? If the song is too popular then I am less likely to arrange it because there are many other songs that deserve a piano arrangement :)
- I try to cover songs from media I am familiar with. If you suggest a song from a video game or movie I haven't heard of then I will need some time to check it out first before deciding!
- Lastly, I am only one person so I am not able to do everyone's request!

**Can I use your arrangement for my video?**

Yes!  
You may create covers or remixes using my piano tutorials, sheet music, or MIDI files as reference. You may also use the audio from my videos as background music for your own videos. Please credit me if possible!  

If you create something based on my piano arrangements, please don't hesitate to show me! I would love to see your creative work.

**Where can I find the sheet music for X arrangement?**

I have organized some of my recent projects in the sidebar of this website, but a lot of my older projects exist in various other pages outside of this website. 
Below is an Airtable with sheet music links to all previous arrangements I have made. It also includes additional links to audio and MIDI files available on Patreon.
