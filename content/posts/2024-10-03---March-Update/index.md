Hello!

I have updated the website to Gatsby v4 and transferred to a new version of the site template which I had been using since 2018. It was a long overdue update - please let me know if you find any broken links or other issues!

New updates also include:
- [TCOAL sheet music](https://pianobin.com/tcoal/)
- [Persona 3 Reload sheet music](https://pianobin.com/p3r)
- Dark mode

More arrangements to come. Thank you for the support!
